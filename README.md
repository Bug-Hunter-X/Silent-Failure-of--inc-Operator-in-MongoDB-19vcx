# Silent Failure of $inc Operator in MongoDB

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update operations.  If the target field doesn't exist, `$inc` silently fails to create the field, leading to unexpected behavior. The solution provides a robust approach to handle this scenario.

## Bug

The provided `bug.js` file shows how an update operation using `$inc` can fail silently when attempting to increment a non-existent field. This behavior can be problematic for debugging and ensuring data integrity.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers a corrected approach using the `$setOnInsert` operator in conjunction with `$inc`. This approach creates the field if it does not exist and then safely increments its value.
